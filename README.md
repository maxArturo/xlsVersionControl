xlsVersionControl
=================

This is an attempt to create a VBA module that will empty out the XML and .bas contents of an Excel workbook (.xlsx, .xlsm, etc) in a Version Control-friendly way.

PLEASE NOTE: 
You need the Scripting Runtime and Microsoft XML (6 or above) references in your project for this module. Thanks!
